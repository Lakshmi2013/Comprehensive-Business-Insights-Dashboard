## Project information

#### Consumer electronics company AtliQ Hardwares is seeing significant growth, but it is unable to compete with businesses that use data because the majority of its reports are still produced in Excel. The organization would be able to get insights and make wise decisions if I successfully develop an advanced analytics solution utilizing Power BI.
